The kickoff meeting of the PAStor project took place on October 9 2020 via a virtual platform.

The main objective of the project is providing a novel Software-Defined Storage (SDS) solution for HPC that can efficiently handle I/O flows from multiple AI workloads by automatically adjusting storage configurations and resources to meet applications dynamic requirements.

By gathering the expertise of [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en) and [Hood College](https://www.hood.edu) researchers in the AI and distributed storage fields, and by including researchers from [TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu) and [MACC](https://macc.fccn.pt) with experience on managing HPC infrastructures, the project will produce new high quality research findings and advance the state-of-the-art for storage solutions currently deployed at HPC centers.
