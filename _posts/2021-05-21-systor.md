INESC TEC's team has published a paper entitled “S2Dedup: SGX-enabled Secure Deduplication” at the 14th ACM International Systems and Storage Conference (SYSTOR ’21), as part of PAStor project, which took place online, between June 14 and 16, 2021. This paper was also selected as best paper runner-up to this conference.

This publication proposes a trusted hardware-based privacy-preserving deduplication system. S2Dedup was designed to support multiple security schemes, which enables tailored deployments for applications with distinct requirements in terms of security, performance, and space savings.

The authors of this paper are Mariana Miranda, Tânia Esteves, and João Paulo, from INESC TEC and University of Minho, and Bernardo Portela, from NOVA LINCS and University of Porto.
