The research outputs from PAStor will be disseminated through top scientific venues in the HPC and storage fields and released as an open-source prototype.  The prototype will provide the first building block towards a novel storage architecture suited for exascale computing infrastructures. The project will include both senior researchers and students who are working on PhD and MSc thesis focused on the scope of the project.

This page will be updated during the project duration.
