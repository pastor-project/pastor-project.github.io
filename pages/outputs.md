The research outputs from PAStor will be disseminated through top scientific venues in the HPC and storage fields and released as an open-source prototype. The prototype will provide the first building block towards a novel storage architecture suited for exascale computing infrastructures. The project will include both senior researchers and students who are working on PhD and MSc thesis focused on the scope of the project.

This page will be updated during the project duration.

* [S2Dedup](https://github.com/mmm97/S2Dedup) is a trusted hardware-based privacy-preserving deduplication system designed to support multiple security schemes that enable different levels of performance, security guarantees and space savings. Such feature is key to ensure S2Dedupâ€™s applicability to a wider range of applications with different requirements. The proposed solution leverages Intel Software Guard Extensions to enable cross-user privacy-preserving deduplication at third-party storage infrastructures.
